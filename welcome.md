### Data Structure Tutorial

## Introduction

Welcome to the Data Structure Tutorial! In this tutorial, we will explore three fundamental data structures: stacks, linked lists, and trees. Each module will provide a detailed explanation of the data structure, accompanied by example Python code, diagrams, and tables. Please note that this tutorial assumes you already have basic programming knowledge in Python.

Before we dive into the modules, let me introduce myself:

## Table of Contents

1. Stacks
2. Linked Lists
3. Trees

## Stacks

The stack data structure follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where elements are added and removed from the same end. In the Stacks module, we will cover the following topics:

* Definition and characteristics of stacks
* Implementation of stacks in Python
* Operations on stacks (push, pop, peek)
* Example problem: Reversing a string using a stack
* Problem for you to solve: Validating parentheses using a stack

## Linked Lists

A linked list is a data structure consisting of nodes connected through pointers or references. In the Linked Lists module, we will explore the following concepts:

* Singly linked lists and doubly linked lists
* Creating and manipulating linked lists in Python
* Operations on linked lists (insertion, deletion, traversal)
* Example problem: Detecting a loop in a linked list
* Problem for you to solve: Finding the nth node from the end of a linked list


## Trees

Trees are hierarchical data structures with nodes connected by edges. In the Trees module, we will delve into the following areas:

* Binary trees and binary search trees
* Tree traversal algorithms (pre-order, in-order, post-order)
* Implementing trees in Python
* Example problem: Finding the lowest common ancestor in a binary search tree
* Problem for you to solve: Determining if a binary tree is a valid binary search tree


Please make sure to read each module carefully, study the examples, and attempt the problem-solving exercises. Good luck with your journey into data structures!
